# WordPress Boilerplate Plugin

WordPress Boilerplate is a boilerplate plugin for WordPress that provides a clear structure for the separation of admin and frontend functions, with support for modern PSR-4 autoloading and best practices in plugin development.
## Features

- Separation of admin and frontend areas
- React integration for admin and frontend components
- psr 4 autoloading
- Hook registration for admin and frontend

## Using the setup script:

The project contains a shell script (`replace.sh`) that replaces the placeholders in the plugin framework with user-defined values. The script facilitates the creation of a new plugin based on the boilerplate.

### Steps for use:

1. Make sure that you make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x replace.sh
2. execute the script:
   ````bash
   ./replace.sh
3. Provide the following information when prompted:
    - Plugin Name: The full name of your plugin (replaces My Plugin Name).
    - Plugin Description: (Replace This is a short description of what the plugin does.)
    - Vendor Name: (Replace MyVendorNamespace)
    - Namespace Name: The namespace of your plugin (replaces MyPluginNamespace).
    - Defined Name: The plugin constant (replaces WP_PLUGIN).
    - Plugin Slug: The slug of your plugin (replaces wp-plugin-name).
    - Plugin Prefix: The prefix for your plugin functions (replaces wp_plugin_name_).
    - Plugin Author Name: (Replace Your Name or Your Company)
    - Plugin Domain: (Replace http://example.com)
4.	The script will replace the placeholders in the files, rename the main plugin file, and adjust the plugin directory accordingly.
5.	Once complete, your pluginâ€™s directory and files will be correctly set up.

## Creating a Release

To package your plugin for distribution, you can use the `build-release` command. This command creates a ZIP archive of your plugin, excluding unnecessary files such as test directories and development dependencies.

### Steps to create a release:

1. Make sure that all necessary dependencies are installed by running:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

2. To create a release, simply run the following Composer script:

    ```bash
    composer run-script build-release
    ```

3. The script will:

   - Remove any existing `_dist-release/` directory.
   - Automatically determine the name of your plugin based on the current directory.
   - Copy all plugin files into the `_dist-release/PLUGIN_NAME` directory, excluding unnecessary files such as `.git`, `node_modules`, `tests`, and development-related files like `.gitignore` and `composer.lock`.
   - Navigate to the `_dist-release/` directory.
   - Create a ZIP file named after your plugin, which contains all the relevant files for distribution.

4. The resulting ZIP file can be found in the `_dist-release/` directory, ready for upload or distribution.
